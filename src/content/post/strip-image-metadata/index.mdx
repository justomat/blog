# Intro

I was applying for New Zealand visa and my photo got rejected for exceeding the max size **AND not meeting the min resolution** at the same time ðŸ˜….
After spending more than 2 seconds trying to form a thought, I decided to just google my problem and hope someone already has.

My first thought was to look for something to strip metadata from the image files. I found most stackoverflow/blogs
recommend using [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/), but I felt reluctant to install a new tool just for
this. A couple searches later, I found that [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) can do the
job. Thats good because I happen to have it installed from a past project.

Anyway here's how I did it:

## Enough talk, show me the code

Okay that should be enough words for SEO, here's the code:

### Setup

First you obviously need to have imagemagick installed, if you're on a mac you can install it using brew:

```sh
brew install imagemagick
```

### What you came here for

Then you can use the `mogrify` command to strip metadata from the image files.:

```sh
mogrify -strip *.png

# Example output:
# input.png PNG 995x956 995x956+0+0 8-bit TrueColorAlpha sRGB 938272B 0.040u 0:00.028
# input.png PNG 995x956 995x956+0+0 8-bit TrueColorAlpha sRGB 938272B 0.160u 0:00.159
```

Don't worry about the `.png` this will work on file format as well.
This command will strip any profiles, comments, or these PNG chunks: (bKGD, cHRM, EXIF, gAMA, iCCP, iTXt, sRGB, tEXt, zCCP, zTXt, date) from the image files.
You can also use the `-verbose` flag to see what is being stripped:

## Some tips

```sh
mogrify -strip -verbose *.png
```

You can also use the `-format` flag to convert the images to a different format, for example to convert all the images to webp:

```sh
mogrify -strip -format webp *.png
```

### What if I want to keep the original files?

There's also the `convert` command to save the output in a different name:

```sh
convert input.png -strip output.png
```

Likewise it has both `-verbose` and `format` flags as well:

```sh
convert input.png -strip -verbose output.png
convert input.png -strip -format webp output.webp
```

### How do I check if the metadata has been stripped?

You can use the `identify` command to check if the metadata has been stripped from the image files:

```sh
identify -verbose input.png
```

You should see that the metadata has been stripped from the image files, here's an example:

# Goodbye

That's all! I hope this helps you strip metadata from image files using imagemagick. Oh and wish me luck on my visa application ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿.
